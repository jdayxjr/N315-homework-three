    <h2>Glazed Donuts</h2>
    <p>Soft, airy, and melt-in-your-mouth good, our glazed donuts are a timeless classic. Each one is coated in a sweet,
        delicate glaze that adds just the right amount of sweetness without overpowering the light and fluffy dough.
        Perfect for any time of day, glazed donuts are loved for their simple, irresistible charm.</p>
    <h2>Cake Donuts</h2>
    <p>For those who prefer a denser, heartier treat, our cake donuts are a must-try. These donuts have a rich, moist
        texture with a slightly crisp exterior. Whether you choose a plain cake donut or one that’s topped with icing,
        sprinkles, or powdered sugar, each bite is packed with flavor and warmth. They’re perfect with a cup of coffee
        or tea!</p>
    <h2>Long John Donuts</h2>
    <p>Our Long John donuts are a crowd-pleaser. Shaped like a bar and generously filled or topped, these donuts are a
        larger-than-life treat. Enjoy them with rich chocolate icing, velvety custard filling, or a classic vanilla
        glaze. Whether you prefer them filled or not, Long Johns are sure to satisfy even the biggest sweet tooth.</p>
    <h2>Donut Holes</h2>
    <p>Small in size but big in flavor, our donut holes are the perfect poppable treat! Made from the same delicious
        dough as our donuts, these bite-sized delights come glazed, dusted in cinnamon sugar, or coated with powdered
        sugar. They’re the ideal snack when you’re craving something sweet on the go or looking for a quick treat to
        share.
